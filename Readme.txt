I used JS/jquery learned in class and through documentation to start the implementation of a scrabble game.
Was sick most of this past week so just did what I could. 
Features:
Loads a new set of tiles everytime
each tile has a specific position on rack
tiles drop only on the rack or on the board
tiles center when dropped on the board
tiles bounce back when dropped in invalid spaces
tiles selected randomly in the beginning
